# 🏡🌍 GIS House Pricing Project

This project aims to analyze house prices using both traditional data science techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools.  
The dataset comes from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition on Kaggle and contains property sales data from Ames, Iowa.

Since the original dataset provides neighborhood names but no exact coordinates, approximate neighborhood-level latitude and longitude values are generated to enable spatial analysis and GIS visualizations.

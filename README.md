# GIS House Pricing Project

This project aims to analyze house prices using both traditional data science techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools.  
We combine structured housing data with spatial neighborhood information to visualize, predict, and better understand the spatial distribution of house prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Geopandas, Folium, Scikit-Learn)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- QGIS
- Git and GitHub
- Medium (for project documentation)
